flora packages help
===================

flora added 3 folders to flora/profiles called 'package.mask', 'sets'
and 'docs'. These folders are there for a special reason and you 
should be aware of some rules that need to be followed to let us all
live peaceful together.

What are the folders there for?
===============================

* flora/profiles/docs
	This folder is there for docs if you need a special setup,
	like using sets for unmasking special stuff.
* flora/profiles/sets
	This folder is there do define a special unmasking set or
	useflagset for packages you sent to flora, your sets should g
	there into subfolders.
* flora/profiles/package.mask
	And finaly as you might already thought here you can set a 
	special mask for packages you submitted. Please don't mask
	packages in here you haven't submitted, if you do so it could
	result in enourmous trouble for the devs and that is
	something we would like to avoid.

rules for flora/profiles/docs
=============================

In 'flora/profiles/docs' you will insert docs for special stuff like
unmasking your ebuilds if you masked them. Please try to avoid a mask
of ebuilds but sometimes it is not possible to avoid it we know.
your doc should be named README.<package> so users can easyly find it.

rules for flora/profiles/sets
=============================

In 'flora/profiles/sets' you will insert sets to unmask several ebuilds
at a time, like if you commit 5 packages that are needed to build and
for testing purpose you decide to mask them first, you can define a
set here to unmask them. These sets go in subfolders of 
'flora/profiles/sets' so you would result in a structure like

	flora/profiles/sets/<packagename>/<packagename>.unmask

The content of such an unmask file could look like that:
	
	#############################################################
	# unmask for <packagename>
	#############################################################
	=<category>/<packagename>-<version>
	...

in the docs you should then tell the user to link 

	'portage-path/profiles/sets/<packagename>/<packagename>.unmask'

into /etc/portage/package.unmask/<packagename> or add the stuff of the
file to /etc/portage/package.unmask depending on their setup. :)

rules for flora/profiles/packages.mask
======================================

Here we use the strongest rules that need to be followed!

* Don't mask any core packages! You are only allowed to mask packages
  you are responsable for. Also if you try to commit core packages
  we could get angry, so please talk about these packages first with
  us. We don't bite but react angry if you try to kill our core :)
* Try to avoid a mask of packages if possible! :)
* Mask reasons have to be significant and should be explained why.
  Remember you are responsable for the mask no Core Team member will
  remove them!
* Users that didn't set the mask are not allowed to remove it! Only
  submitter is allowed to do so! :)

Four simple rules that you must follow so we don't get into trouble :)

For 'flora/profiles/packages.mask' we advice the following setup:

	flora/profiles/packages.mask/funtoo-flora-<username>

so we don't have to care about 3 guys editing the same file and giving
us headaches when we merge :)

if you follow these few rules we are sure we all make it up in a good
manner here and live next to each other in peace.

Greetings
